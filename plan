Goal:
  MVP: An app that makes it easy to record how I spend my time
  Extensions: 
    Nice graphs showing this data
    A todo list and an option for the app to tell you how to spend your time
  
Url structure:
  Give each user a unique string. So, to add an entry to my timesheet, I would go to #{base_url}/#{my_string}

Pages:
  root: root of each user. Has links to add_time, graphs, maybe other things.
    maybe later we want to pull more things into this page but for now lets keep each thing on its own page
  add_time: propmts you to enter what you did and when. Adds this info to a database

Database:
  Name: name
  User_string: unique_string
  Events: [
    Start_time: # time includes date
    Duration: # or end_time?
    Name: Some string
  ]
  # Could add other info? (gender, email??)

Directory structure:
  server.coffee: Define basic things about the server
  pages/page_name:
    routes.coffee: define the routes needed by that page (app.get/app.post)
    index.jade: Jadefile
    scripts/main.coffee: frontend js
    styles/main.less: css
  lib/*.coffee: Backend libraries - maybe helper functions or analysis tools later.

  After build:
    server -> build/server.js
    each page -> build/pages/page_name:
      routes.js
      index.jade
      main.js
      main.css
    lib -> build/lib-js


Url structure:
  /: Links to things (blog)
  /mystring: user_homepage
    /add_time: add an entry
    /graphs: see graphs
